# Quantum Algorithm Tutorials
This collection of Juypter Notebook files is designed as a teaching guide for someone interested in learning the basics of quantum algorithms.  The code used for these lessons come from the following quantum languages:

**Rigetti:** PyQuil  -- link
**IBM:**     QisKit  -- link
**ProjectQ**       -- Link

All of the tutorials provided here come in all three of these major quantum languages, so feel free to use whichever lanague you are most interested in.  If for some reason one of the languages isn't work properly (as they tend to update their syntax regularly), I encourage you to explore the other languages as backups.  All of the tutorials are exactly the same, so learning the core ideas using one language should translate very seemlessly to the other two, once you understand each language's syntax.

## Getting Started

All of the code is written for Python, with code provided for both .py (Python) and .ipynb (Jupyter Noteboke).  For an IDE to run the codes, I reccomend using the Anaconda Distribution.

The code requires Python 3.5 or higher

Once you have Anaconda, or another Python IDE up and running, download all of the python files and put them together in a location somwhere on your computer. For example, store them in a folder on your desktop labeled "Quantum Algorithms".

**Two important notes here:**
**1)** You should create seperate working diretories (folders) for each quantum language.  This way each language can call upon the proper files and run as intended.  

**2)** In each given folder for the three languages, make sure that all of the python files be stored in the correct location location, so that the tutorial files created for these lessons can call upon each language correctly.

For a full guide in setting up each language, please watch the following video:

## Reccomended Starting Point

Understanding quantum algorithms is no trivial task, so keep that in mind when beginning to go through the tutorials.  A background in classical coding is great, but many of the underlying principles that make quantum algorithms successful are fundamentally different.  Thus, if you are someone coming from absoltuely no background in quantum physics, wavefunctions, probabilities, etc. -- I strongly reccomend starting with the tutorial series **"Quantum From Nothing"**.  If you already have an understanding of quantum physics, but would like just a quick refresher on some of the terminonolgy and main concepts needed for algorithms, i suggest starting with the **"Brief Quantum Primer"** series.

If you have worked with quantum algorithms already, then the various tutorials presented in this collection are fully stand-alone lessons designed to explain some of the most popular quantum algorithms.

## Coding Style Disclaimer

I am a physicist (quantum computer scientist?), not a professional software engineer.  If my codes fail to meet some coding etiquettes, I apologize!  I've spent quite a good deal of time making the codes as presentable and user-friendly as they are now, but I know they are still a little rough around the edges.
